//!
//! Provides an easy, asyncronous way of interacting with open metaverse servers in Rust.
//! Handles packet IO between client and server, exposing a UDS interface for simple integration
//! into other projects.

//!
//! <div class="warning">This crate is in development!</div>
//! This isn't ready for any kind of serious use yet! Check back later for updates!
